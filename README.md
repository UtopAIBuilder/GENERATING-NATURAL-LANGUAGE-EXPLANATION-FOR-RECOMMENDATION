# GENERATING-NATURAL-LANGUAGE-EXPLANATION-FOR-RECOMMENDATION
I have implemented Cheng et al, “Generate natural language
explanations for recommendation”-EARS-2019. In this paper, the authors propose
a hierarchical sequence-to-sequence model (HSS) with auto-
denoising for personalized recommendation and natural lan-
guage explanation generation. In particular, the paper makes
the following contributions: 1. Authors propose a hierarchical
generation model, which is able to collaboratively learn over
multiple sentences from different users for explanation sen-
tence generation. 2. Based on item feature words extracted
from reviews, The authors propose a feature-aware attention
model to implicitly select explanation sentences from reviews
for model learning, and we further introduce a feature atten-
tion model to enhance the feature-level personality of the ex-
planations. For details see the report
